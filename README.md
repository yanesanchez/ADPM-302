## **Intro to Code Assignment 2: Interact With Code**

Make a p5.js sketch that responds to user input/interaction on a mobile device. Choose one of the following themes for your interaction:

- **Thinking or learning through doing:** For example, how could you make a digital sketchbook or prototyping tool?
- **Visibility/Invisibility:** For example, can you make a system that reveals something not normally seen? Or hides something?
- **Risk:** For example, how can you make a user commit to making consequential choices? What happens when those consequences are irreversible?
- **Real-world Interfaces:** For example, how could you use everyday gestures or objects instead of standard mobile device inputs?

### **Restrictions:**

- Make your sketch 360 by 640 pixels (either landscape or portrait orientation)
- Interaction/variation may be triggered by any combination of touch, function calls such as random(), and/or other input as you see fit.
- Your sketch's interaction/variation should trigger meaningful changes to some of the following qualities of your composition:
    - Image hierarchy
    - Color palette
    - Scale/Proportion
    - Positive/Negative Space
    - Zones of Recession
    - Readability
    - Graphic Style
    - Point of View
    - Projection System

### **What to Turn In:**

A URL link to your p5.js sketch. (Copy by clicking on the File->Share menu item, and using the 'Present' link). Please note you must be logged in to the p5js.org site to save & share your sketch.

### **Rubric (4pts)**

- Sketch is correct size; commented; and runs without errors
- Use of interactive triggers such as touch and/or other input
- Meaningful compositional changes as listed above
- Creative/Expressive/Conceptual quality of interaction + visuals

### **Research**

1. Spend time looking at these artists. Think about how their examples might fit into the assignment prompt:

2. Get to know these design terms:
    - **Animation:** A simulation of movement by the rapid appearance of images in sequence.
    - **Data Type:** the kind of information stored in a variable. Variables usually have just one data type, even if the value of that data changes. Some common data types for this unit:
        - **Numbers:** a primitive data type that stores whole integers or decimal point values.
        - **Booleans:** a primitive data type that stores only the value true, or false.
        - **Strings:** a primitive data type that stores one or more characters used to represent text.
        - **Arrays:** use one variable to store multiple values of the same data type in a list.
        - **Objects:** store multiple related values and behaviors in one variable
    - **Event:** An action such as a key being pressed, the mouse moving, or a new piece of data becoming available to be read. An event interrupts the normal flow of a program to run the code within an event block.
    - Input: In coding terms, data from outside the sketch. This could come in the form of one or more keyboard presses; a mouse action/location; sound; sensor data; etc.
    - **Interactive/Dynamic:** Having the ability to change or take influence from something. Sketches that are interactive give some sort of agency to the artist or viewer, allowing them to make changes by participating in a two-way flow of information between themselves and the sketch.
    - **Return:** Information produced by a function. For example, the random() function *returns*a floating point number within a given range.
    - **Variable:** A piece of information stored in the computer's memory. Variables are given names with which they can be used or changed. Every variable has a name, value, data type, and scope.
3. In preparation for the assignment, lectures will focus on the above topics as well as:
    - Variables in p5.js (mouseX, mouseY)
    - Variables in p5.js (Define Your Own)
    - Incrementation Operators
    - The map() Function
    - random() Function
    - How to Use Data Types for Variables in p5js
    - JavaScript Objects
